# Spots

I am building the "Spots" social media web applications.

The default profile's avatar image remain the same(for now) but their description can be editted.

The user can also add new cards, with an image, from an URL, and a name/caption text. When submitted the new card is added to the top of the card list.

The user can even like ❤️ and delete existing cards.

When editting an existing card, adding a new card or viewing an existing cards preview, the modal can now be closed using the ecsape key or clicking outside of the window.
